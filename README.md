## **Project Overview**
Crave NYC is a user-friendly platform that connects people to local New York City restaurants, drawing from the NYC Open Restaurants API. With summer weather on the rise, the site helps users discover dining spots across all five boroughs — whether they're looking for a specific borough, outdoor seating, or locations that serve alcohol. Visitors can search and filter results based on their preferences, including pet-friendly options, making it easy to plan the perfect bite in the city.

## **Features**

- There are three distinct filters (interactions):
    - By borough 
    - Seating type
    - Alcohol Served

- Additional interactions:
    - Pagination (shows 10 restaurants at a time)
    - Users can reset the search, and filter again.


## **Technologies Used**

NYC Open Restaurants [API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/43nn-pn8j.json)

- Information on the API:
    - The NYC Open Restaurants API is a public dataset that shares information about restaurants participating in New York City's outdoor dining program. It is now closed, but it was useful during the Covid-19 pandemic (2019-2021) when many restaurants took part in the program. It includes details like the restaurant's name, location, seating type, alcohol service, and permit status. 


## **Future Enhancements**

- Iteration #1:
    - A valuable future improvement for Crave NYC would be integrating a map-based browsing feature. Instead of relying solely on form filters like borough checkboxes, users could explore restaurants by moving around an interactive map. As they pan or zoom into different areas of the city, only the tiles for restaurants within the visible map region would appear. This would offer a more intuitive, location-aware experience — allowing users to discover nearby spots in real time based on where they are on the map, rather than manually selecting from a list

- Iteration #2: 
    - The tiles currently simply appear based on the filters the user chooses, but it would be nice to have been able to click into them. 
        - additional interactions:
            - modals  that appear when the user clicks on a restaurant tile, on the map. 
            - Descriptions of the restaurants.

- Iteration #3:
    - The API we used for the project doesn’t have the data, but an interesting iteration would pulling customer reviews from another source/ API. So that the user could see the reviews of the restaurant from pas customers.
